# House Price Prediction with Data Science

Welcome to our exciting project where we predict house prices using advanced data science techniques for the Kaggle competition "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques." Our submission achieved an impressive score of 0.14810, securing the 2559th rank on the leaderboard. Below is a systematic overview of our approach:

## Data Exploration
We began by importing essential libraries and reading the dataset. This initial step was followed by a comprehensive overview of the data's basic information and summary statistics for both numerical and categorical variables.

## Data Preprocessing
To ensure the data was in prime condition for modeling, we conducted extensive preprocessing, including:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handled any missing or inconsistent values.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features to enhance the predictive power of our model.
- **Outlier Removal**: Removed outliers from the target variable to maintain data integrity.
- **Feature Selection**: Used Absolute Correlation, Random Forest Feature Importance, and Graph of Value Counts of Categorical Variables to select the most relevant features.

## Test Data Preparation
Preparing the test data was a crucial step. We loaded the test dataset and applied similar preprocessing steps to ensure consistency with our training data.

## Model Building
Using the meticulously prepared data, we built a robust predictive model. This involved:
- **Pipelines**: Established pipelines to handle scaling and preprocessing.
- **Model Implementation**: Implemented and tuned various models to find the best fit for our data.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance to ensure it met our accuracy standards.

## Model Evaluation and Prediction
Finally, we evaluated the model's performance and made predictions. This structured methodology not only provided us with accurate predictions but also deepened our understanding of the factors influencing house prices.

Through this comprehensive approach, we demonstrated the power of data science in making precise and reliable predictions in the real estate domain. If you're interested in the details of our journey, feel free to reach out or check out the full project on my profile!
